# CGI's Vocabularies

This repository contains the source files of the Commission for the Management and Application of Geoscience Information (CGI)'s public vocabularies. 

All these vocabularies are presented as RDF data files that conform to the [VocPrez Profile](https://w3id.org/profile/vocprez) of the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/). SKOS is a taxonomy data model and VocPrez is a profile mandating certain metadata for system handling.
