There are kinds of narrowly defined ControlledConcepts that might not allow 'instances' that are different from the DefiningNorm. It might be worth considering a different relationship between MappedFeature and an Instance GeologicEntity, with the GeologicEntity role being 'description'."@en ;

This description may include many properties that are not part of the DefiningNorm. For example, the fact that granite is typically light-colored is not a defining property, but is certainly a useful typical property. These kinds of descriptions would be used to address queries like 'This area is within a polygon classified as Podunk Formation, what sort of lithology am I most likely to encounter when I start digging?' The Podunk Formation may be defined by the presence of a certain ammonite... TypicalNorm description would be constructed as a summary over many Instance descriptions."@en ;
