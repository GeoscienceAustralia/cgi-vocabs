    skos:definition "Near-synonyms are terms whose meanings are generally regarded as different, but which are treated as equivalents for the purposes of a controlled vocabulary. The extent to which terms are treated as near-synonyms depends in large measure upon the domain covered by the controlled vocabulary and its size. Near-synonyms may include antonyms or represent points on a continuum. Examples: sea water / salt water [variant terms] meteors / meteorites / meteoroids [points on a continuum] smoothness / roughness [antonyms] For each of these sets of near synonyms, a vocabulary developer might decide to designate one of the terms as the preferred term with the understanding that it will retrieve all content described by the other terms as well. As a general rule, terms should be treated as near-synonyms only in subject areas that are peripheral to the domain of the controlled vocabulary. When concepts can be distinguished in the controlled vocabulary domain with sufficient precision to justify their representation as separate terms, they should be individually defined and retained. If two concepts cannot be consistently and reliably differentiated from each otherhowever, a term for one concept should be selected as the preferred term and a USE reference made from the other."@en ;

For time interval concepts (ordinal eras) (Allen and Ferguson, 1994), this relationship subsumes ‘During’, ‘Interval starts’, and ‘Interval finishes’.

    skos:definition "This relationship identifies the link between a source class term and target members or species. This type of relationship is often called 'IsA'. A simple way to apply the test for validity described above is to formulate the statement '[narrower term] is a [broader term].' This relationship is also amenable to a logical \\all-and-some\\ test. An example that passes this test is that some members of the class succulent plants are known as cacti and that all cacti, by definition and regardless of context, are succulent plants. An example that fails the test is that some members of the class 'desert plants' are known as 'cacti', some, but not all, 'cacti' are 'desert plants'. These terms should therefore be assigned to different hierarchies in the controlled vocabulary, and both terms should be assigned to the same content object when indexing a work on \\cacti as desert plants..\\ Inverse relationship 'narrower generic term' is not included in this"@en ;
